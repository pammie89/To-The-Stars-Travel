# Galaxy Travel - Practice Build

This project is site with a fictional service of helping clients book travel to the cosmos.  This site was built with React and React Router.  It is a multipage site build that provided me with practice in understanding how routing works with react apps.

It was a truly fun build.

## Recognition

This was a follow along tutorial that I was lucky to come across on youtube.  Clint Briley provides a great resource of follow along coding practice videos to choose from, so anyone learning React, I would suggest to check him out on Youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmT9TwcIb_yAe7-Uqhn3fBA
